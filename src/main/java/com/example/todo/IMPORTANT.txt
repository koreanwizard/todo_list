Things that I've learned through this project!!
ToDo.java

A default(no-argument) constructor from ToDo class:
The JPA requires every Entity (table from db) class has to include a default no-arg constructor.
This can be public or protected but regardless of JPA specification, every class object
should provide a default constructor explicitly.




Reflection:
JPA utilizes reflection to access every member, annotation, and relation while creating SQL queries.


Spring HATEOAS:
It helps me to create hypermedia-driven outputs (level 3 REST API).

EntityModel<T>: a generic container that includes the data of a certain ToDo
and a collection of links (hyperlinks that can possibly access).

CollectionModel<>: a container to encapsulate collections of resources (able to include links)
‚≠ê The CollectionModel should include every ToDo's resource NOT the ToDo itself.
